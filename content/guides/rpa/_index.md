## What is RPA

**Robotic Process Automation** Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a low to no-code Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technology that can be used to automate repetitive, rules-based tasks. Like an Excel macro operating within a spread-sheet, RPA can record actions performed across a personal computer, access systems, and perform delineated tasks for human users.  

RPA products vary in their exact capabilities, but all RPA technologies emulate human actions, enabling process owners or staff with appropriate training to rapidly design, test, and deploy automations dramatically reducing an organization’s low-value workload.  

Popular uses of RPA include data entry, data reconciliation, spreadsheet manipulation, systems integration, automated data reporting, analytics, and customer outreach and communications.

## Why Deploy RPA at Your Agency  
Federal agencies are under continuous pressure to do more with fewer resources. Federal mandates such as OMB’s [M-18-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/M-18-23.pdf) provide guidance to agencies to pursue operational improvements, greater efficiencies, increased capabilities, and technology modernization. RPA’s proven advantages is with reduced implementation time, increased organizational capacity, improved employee engagement, qualitative benefits in process execution, and wide-ranging applicability across functions and agency priorities.

## RPA Community of Practice
The [RPA Community of Practice (CoP)](https://digital.gov/communities/rpa/) helps agencies share solutions to overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, privacy, and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge government-wide impact of RPA.  

Specifically, the CoP assists agencies in developing programs that are cost-effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations.  

Notably, the CoP does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information, and experience.
