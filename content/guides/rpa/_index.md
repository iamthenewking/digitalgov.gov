## What is RPA?

**Robotic Process Automation** is a means of streamlining business processes through the use of software robots. By configuring bots to execute repetitive tasks that need to be performed in a business process, we are able to emulate human actions in a digital system so that employees are saved from performing mundane tasks repeatedly for the same process. Unlike a human employee, however, RPA bots produce no human error and act only as their coding permits.

The [RPA Community of Practice (CoP)](https://digital.gov/communities/rpa/) helps agencies share solutions to overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program.
