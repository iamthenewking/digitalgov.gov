## RPA Use Case Inventory

Hosted by the Federal [RPA Community of Practice (CoP)](https://digital.gov/communities/rpa/), the Federal RPA Use Case Inventory aims to capture all RPA use cases from across the federal government. This list of automations will help agencies create additional capacity, increase efficiency, enhance quality, and drive greater compliance.   

For each automation, the inventory includes descriptive data such as agency name, business function, a high-level description of the use case, and an estimate of the annualized capacity provided.

The Goals of the Use Case Inventory are to: 

-   **Increase awareness** of current RPA applications across the Federal Government to increase knowledge sharing, and accelerated adoption of innovative technologies.  
-   Facilitate the **consolidation and sharing of individual agency RPA applications** to increase ROI and leverage economies of scale (government-wide solutions).  
-   Develop **standardized performance metrics** for RPA deployments that allow accurate statements about government-wide impact of innovative technologies.
